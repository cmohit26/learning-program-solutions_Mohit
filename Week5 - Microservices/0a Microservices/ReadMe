# 🚫 Code Not Uploaded Due to Authentication Privacy Constraints

## 🔒 Project Status: Code Withheld for Security Reasons

This repository was created to showcase a project that I developed, but **unfortunately, the code cannot be uploaded here due to authentication and credential privacy concerns**.

The implementation includes sensitive credentials or access tokens tied to private infrastructure, which I am unable to expose publicly. As a result, the source code has been withheld to maintain the integrity and security of the systems involved.

## 📁 Available Materials

Although the code is not present in this repository, I have included the **outputs and results generated by the project**, so you can still get an idea of how it works and what it produces.

### ✅ Included:
- Screenshots / output logs
- Sample results or visualizations
- Descriptions of the functionality and workflow

You can find these files under the [`/outputs`](./outputs/) folder (or in the Attachments section, if this is not a repo).

Performance Testing in JUnit??

	-> Performance testing means checking how fast or efficient your code runs, often by measuring whether it completes within a certain time limit.
	-> While JUnit is mainly designed for functional testing (checking correctness), it also provides some simple tools to help you assert your code runs within expected time limits.

	assertTimeout()
		-> Asserts that a piece of code finishes execution within a specified duration.
		-> If the code takes longer than the timeout, the test fails.
		-> Does not interrupt the code if it exceeds the timeout â€” it waits for completion then fails.

		assertTimeout(Duration.ofMillis(500), () -> {
			// Code that should finish within 500 milliseconds
		});
